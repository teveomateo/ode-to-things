    <h1>YERBA MATE</h1>

    <h2>Mate is more than just a drink ...</h2>

    <p>The “mate” is a traditional Argentinean beverage. </p>

    <p>It is a tea-like infusion made from the crushed leaves of the yerba-mate plant. </p>

    <p>It contains caffeine, proving to have a reviving effect. The infusion is traditionally drunk in social settings, and family and friends share it together. The drinkers sit down in a circle and pass the mate around. The cebador, (server) is the one who will ensure that everybody gets their turn while ensuring a quality mate. </p>

    <h2>My mate</h2>

    <p> Each mate gourd is special in its own way. They come in all shape and sizes, colors, and materials. Even though a hollowed out gourd is recommended, you can also make one out of wood. Worst case-scenario you can use a glass one, but other materials can affect the taste. My mate is a dried and hollowed calabash, covered in leather and camo. And my bombilla (straw) was a gift from my dad.</p>
